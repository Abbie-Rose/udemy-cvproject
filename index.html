    <h1>This site is a <span class="creative">playground</span> <br> while I learn to code. Again.</h1>
    <p class="intro">I am a freelance Designer living in Northern Tasmania. In my spare time I cook, sail and code. If you've found this website it's probably through a random zine I've made. <br>
    This site is a work in progress, I have big plans for it... but I'm currently learning how to code... again... beginning with the basics (so back to HTML, CSS & JS).
    That's why this site is a bit bare-bones right now... check back in a few months... it might be more interesting then.
    <br>I'm planning to re-build it eventually, using the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> methodology and lean web concepts... and I'll probably create it's first 'proper' iteration using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Mostly a Designer</h2>
      <p class="card-text">I've been drawing since I could hold a crayon. My mum made me learn how to touch-type in primary school. Today I combine those skills by creating brands, websites and publications for my clients.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Sometimes a Cook</h2>
      <p>I don't like to blow my own trumpet üé∫... but you are on my website... so I'll just tell you I'm a damn fine cook and I love feeding people üçΩ üë©‚Äçüç≥. Sometimes I get to do it professionally.</p>
