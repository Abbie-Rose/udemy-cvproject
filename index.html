    <br>This site is a work in progress, I use it as a playground... I have dreams of building it into a blog built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>... but good things take time haha.
    <br>I'm planning to re-build it eventually, using the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> methodology and lean web concepts.</p>
