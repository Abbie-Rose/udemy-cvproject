    <p class="intro">I am a freelance Designer living in Northern Tasmania. In my spare time I cook, sail, garden and make zines. If you've found this website it's probably through Rye or Salt Zine.<br>
    This site is a work in progress, I use it as a playground... I have dreams of building it into a blog built with 11ty... but good things take time haha.
    <br>I'm planning to re-build it eventually, using the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> methodology and lean web concepts... and I'll probably create it's first 'proper' iteration using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Mostly a Designer</h2>
      <p class="card-text">I've been drawing since I could hold a crayon. My mum made me learn how to touch-type in primary school. Today I combine those skills by creating brands, websites and publications for my clients.</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Sometimes a Cook</h2>
      <p>I don't like to blow my own trumpet 🎺... but you are on my website... so I'll just tell you I'm a damn fine cook and I love feeding people 🍽 👩‍🍳. Sometimes I get to do it professionally.</p>
